## 10/28/2025 - Research  

Looked at existing projects, components and the data sheet of the E ink display.
so found out that most of the good display eink display have a similar kind of connection.

so the basic sketch for the project is that i will be fetching the weather data using APIs and will be using a ESP32 Xiao c3 as the MCU and a 4.2 inch e ink display 

planning to design a PCB taking reference from existing projects and the Eink datasheet.

stil figuring out how the the enclosure would look.....
