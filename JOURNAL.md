## 10/28/2025 - Research  

Looked at existing projects, components and the data sheet of the E ink display.
so found out that most of the good display eink display have a similar kind of connection.

so the basic sketch for the project is that i will be fetching the weather data using APIs and will be using a ESP32 Xiao c3 as the MCU and a 4.2 inch e ink display 

planning to design a PCB taking reference from existing projects and the Eink datasheet.

stil figuring out how the the enclosure would look.....

## 10/29/2025 - Completed the PCB and Schematic   

Soo looked at datasheet look at multiple references online and made the schematic.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjUwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ffe2d3045c8a3b524028cff54aa75074f7827b74/image.png)

started the PCB right away and spend a considerable amt of time routing it and make it look as clean as possible . i would say i like the look of it clean and compact.
